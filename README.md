## Hi!

This is my personal portfolio website. It's built with Next.JS since I find it super easy to use and it conveniently has a built-in pattern for server API routes for keeping back-end API logic off-client, as well as a middleware feature that's useful for delivering different versions of pages to desktop and mobile clients.

I have made the repo for my website public so that my code can be inspectable (and hopefully impress any potential employers :)
Edit 3/19/25: Going back over this there are lots of instances of coding flourishes that are actually much less readable than more verbose best practices. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/ElleFioLange/art-ellelm) for my art portfolio website to see how I've learned from my errors.

Please feel free to email me with any comments or questions at [elle.fio.lange@gmail.com](mailto:elle.fio.lange@gmail.com)!
