## Hi!

This is my personal portfolio website. It's built with Next.JS since I find it super easy to use and it conveniently has a built-in pattern for server API routes for keeping back-end API logic off-client.

I have made the repo for my website public so that my code can be inspectable (and hopefully impress any potential employers :)

Please feel free to email me with any comments or questions at [elle.fio.lange@gmail.com](mailto:elle.fio.lange@gmail.com)!
