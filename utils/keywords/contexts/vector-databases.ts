Vector Databases are database system that are built around quick embedding comparisons in order to find relevant contextual information when building RAG LLMs.
They are necessary for systems that have massive volumes of individual context data that have to be compared to the input query.
They work by using pre-calculated clustering metadata in order to quickly filter down the number of embeddings that need to be directly compared to the input query.`;
