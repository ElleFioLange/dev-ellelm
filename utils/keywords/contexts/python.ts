Python was the first programming language I learned back in 2009. These days I mostly use it in Jupyter notebooks in the context of data transformations or model fine-tuning.
Python is an excellent language for drilling into the fundamentals of computer science. It is high-level and easy to use, yet robust enough to build complex and scalable systems.
While I would describe it as a secondary skill of mine, it makes a frequent appearance in my projects for scripting or data manipulation tasks.`;
