CSS is one of those things that either you love or you hate, and I'm firmly in the former camp.
I've been using CSS since 2019 and now find it to be the quickest and simplest system for UI design.
I tend to prefer designing through quick CSS adjustments as opposed to Figma, since it is guaranteed to be implementable, whereas Figma designs can sometimes work well in their limited context, but when trying to translate them into a responsive design system, can need to be reworked.`;
