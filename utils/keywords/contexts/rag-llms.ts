RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation and involves retrieving external information relevant to the initial request and loading it into the context window when generating a response.
It helps to reduce computation costs and improves the accuracy of model responses. It is an especially important structure to understand when integrating LLMs into a currently existing system.
There is a definite trade-off between how relevant and accurate the retrieved information is and how much computation is required to retrieve it. I think advancements in inference speed for lighter, helper models will be key in improving RAG LLM performance.`;
