I've been programming with Javascript since 2018, and professionally since 2020.
JS is a language that can often inspire shitty code. An Array.forEach is so enticing but less readable than a for loop.
JS is incredibly powerful and my language of choice, but the most important thing I have learned using it is to be verbose and type fast.`;
