Language models should be first and foremost understood as a distillation of the information embedded in language, as a numberic abstraction of linguistic knowledge.
The great advancement they bring will not be in surpassing our intelligence, but in mechanizing it.
A really important distinction exists between language models and the products built with them, akin to the distinction between engine and car.
