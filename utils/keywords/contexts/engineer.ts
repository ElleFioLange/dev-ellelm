Engineering is a love of problems and puzzles, of systems and their interactions. Its fruit is intuition.
Tinkering and pulling apart has long been a habit of mine. Tnkering with language is what I do when writing.
Tinking with a language model is the natural progression, and I would love more opportunities to find the puzzles at their edges.`;
