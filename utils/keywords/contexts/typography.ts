Typography is one of my great loves. Type is such a beautiful and expressive medium. It is the fashioning of language.
*What* can be said is a finite set built by *how* it can be said. I have things to say, but I most want to build new methods to say them with.
While my goal is not to make fonts, I think it is still aim to accomplish a sort of typography, a sort of biological typography.`;
